# student-exam-scores-predictions
This is a multiple regerssion model to predict exam scores of high school students based on several external factors.
There were two phases to this project: visualization and then the machine learning.
Scikit-Learn's Linear Regression implementation was used to create the models.
In addition, the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries were used for preparing and visualizing the data.
If you wish to run this yourself, you will need the Pandas library, the Matplotlib library, and the Scikit-Learn library with its respective implementations.
You will also need the student exam scores dataset to read into the program, which will be provided.
This dataset was obtained through Kaggle. Note: This data is fictional. These are not based on any real students.
Jupyter Notebook will be required to run this file locally, however, the code can be typed out into a .py file and run that way.
Otherwise, the results can be viewed here.
